                     will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

                  <h4>Severability</h4>
                  <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such
                     provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
                     provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the

                  <h4>Waiver</h4>
                  Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
                  performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's
                  ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
                  thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
                  subsequent breach.
